# excel2TS

A userscript hosted by Tampermonkey that automatically converts XML data into new ticket entries through the TeamSupport API.

Use ticketSchema.xml to create an XML Source mapping on Excel and drag and drop the schema mappings to columns in an Excel spreadsheet. The exported XML file is what the userscript will use.
